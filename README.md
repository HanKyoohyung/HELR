# Logistic Regression on Encrypted Data

## How to run this program?

In 'Debug' folder, just use 'make' command (might need to type 'make clean' first if you re-construct this program).

This will construct 'SecureML' file that we can run.

To test logistic regression on encrypted data, you need to activate those tests in main.cpp file.

Notice that you might need to change the path to the NTL library and HEAANBOOT library.
